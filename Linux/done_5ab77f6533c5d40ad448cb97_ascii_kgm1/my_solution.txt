password length must be 9 bytes

first 8 characters of password are XORed with hardcoded bytes  {0x45, 0x36, 0xab, 0xc8, 0xcc, 0x11, 0xe3, 0x7a}


checksum of the resulting 8 bytes is calculated.
Lowest byte of this checksum has to be in range <97, 123). Between 'a' and 'z'.

Last byte of the password must be equal to the calculated checksum.

Example calculation in Python:
valid key = "r>:%s1a3g"

key_bytes = [0x45, 0x36, 0xab, 0xc8, 0xcc, 0x11, 0xe3, 0x7a]
password = [ord(x) for x in "r>:%s1a3g"]

XORed intermediate result:
Note: See that last byte of the password is skipped and is not a part of this calculation.

tmp = [p^k for p,k  in zip(passwd[:-1], key)] = [55, 8, 145, 237, 191, 32, 130, 73]

sum of XORed intermediate result:
hex(sum(tmp) & 0xFF)
'0x67' which is 'g'

Therefore this password is really valid.
