Solved using ltrace

Just push a random string to input and ltrace output shows invocation of strcmp of your pasword with value "KS-LICENSE-KEY-2021-REV-1"
So key is probably this. Let's try it

ltrace ./license_checker_1 KS-LICENSE-KEY-2021-REV-1

└──╼ $./license_checker_1 KS-LICENSE-KEY-2021-REV-1
