Using strings: 
    we can see some hardcoded string variables. One of them is "pass". Let's try it.

    └──╼ $./easyAF
    Enter the password: pass
    Welldone!

    DONE

Using Ghidra:
    we can see a std::string comparison of the user input string with a hardcoded value "pass". Unfortunatelly this is not visible with strace or ltrace.
